The only acceptable punishment is to kick Real Madrid out of the competition and banish Perez from any football related activity with immediate effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here you can read all the comments that President of Real Madrid and European Super League has made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If the players participating in the European Super League are banned from playing the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, we will create our own World Cup tournament. It is not a big deal.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Football is the only sport in the world with more than 4 billion supporters and our responsibility within the big clubs is to meet the wishes of those fans.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Football is going through a very tough situation, and the Super League will save the clubs financially.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;The more competitive games, the more revenue clubs will generate and that is how they will survive this situation. The Super League is the solution.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;We came to the conclusion that having the Super League instead of the Champions League, we could help alleviate the lost income.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Football has to evolve.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;UEFA is a monopoly, they had to say what they said today.&rdquo;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;It\'s over.

The idea was for the top European football clubs to break away from UEFA and start their own competition in 2021. The report by Der Spiegel sent shockwaves through football with clubs afraid they wouldn&rsquo;t be a part of the competition and fans feeling that another tournament would be too much in the landscape of football.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plans outlined by Der Speigel claimed a 16-team tournament would begin as early as 2021. The competition would be similar to the Champions League except UEFA would play no part in the European Super League. Teams would play in a group stage followed by knockout rounds to claim a Europea Super League champion.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The format of the competition would favour some of the strongest, biggest clubs in European football. Of the 16 teams contesting the competition, 11 would be labelled as &ldquo;core founding&rdquo; clubs. These 11 clubs would be guaranteed their places in the Super League for 20 years. The clubs would be &ldquo;immune to relegation&rdquo;. The other five places would be made up of teams that could be relegated from the competition.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is claimed that a European Super League would usher in the end of the Champions League, the most popular cup competition in world football. It is also believed that a Super League would negatively affect domestic competitions as clubs would focus on the breakaway competition due to the amount of money at stake.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;', 1, '2021-04-26 19:43:33'),

While Florentino Perez and Andrea Agnelli are absolute money-chasers that do not understand football, the ESL saga does not make the UEFA/FIFA saints. Their interest in Qatar, claims that the country isn\'t as bad is bonkers. They stopped the big clubs mafia from getting money...because it\'s theirs - for now at least. The UCL budget having been announced to rise from 4B to 7B, UEFA/FIFA are the enemies of the story as well. They haven&rsquo;t saved football.&lt;/p&gt;', 1, '2021-04-26 19:44:20'),

They roomed together all the way back in 2005 when Argentina won the Under-20 World Cup and they struck up a real relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been mates ever since. When they play for the national team you see that relationship and they are on a wavelength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always wanted to seem them together at club level and I think PSG reportedly being interested is a way of trying to get Messi. Barcelona being interested is a way of perhaps keeping Messi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;It depends how much money you&rsquo;re going to pay him. Are you really going to pay top dollar? Especially if you&rsquo;re in the financial situation Barcelona are in.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aguero first met Messi back when they were teenagers preparing for the Under-20 World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he later admitted to not knowing who he was, despite being at Barcelona.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;We were all staying together, my age group and his age group.&rdquo; Aguero told &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p50g7kV3o1o&amp;amp;ab_channel=SkySportsRetro&quot;&gt;Sky Sports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;I remember there was a kid there I&rsquo;d seen on TV who was at Barcelona.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;We were all sat round a table, Garay, Leo, Formica and myself.

Does he play in the United States?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Then I said to him quietly, &lsquo;what&rsquo;s your name again?&rsquo; And he says &lsquo;Leo&rsquo;. I said &lsquo;no, what&rsquo;s your name?&rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;He said &lsquo;Lionel Messi&rsquo;.
